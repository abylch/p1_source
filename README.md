# Terraform Project 1

This project aims to create a complete DevOps work environment by integrating several tools into an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform and Ansible. The infrastructure setup includes creating a VPC, a public subnet, a security group, a route table, a key pair, and an internet gateway. Additionally, Route 53 will be added to the architecture. Furthermore, an EventBridge will be implemented to automatically turn on and off the EC2 instance at specific times, and alerts will be configured to notify when the EC2 instance is turned on or off using SNS and CloudWatch. Finally, Ansible will be used to install Jenkins and Docker on the EC2 instance.

## Steps:

## Using Terraform
- Create a VPC
- Create 1 Public Subnet
- Create Security group
- Create Route table
- Create Keypair
- Create Internet Gateway
- Create Event Bridge Scheduler
- Create SNS Topic Subscription
- Create Create CloudWatch Event
